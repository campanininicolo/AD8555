AD8555 library for Arduino

The AD8555 is a zero-drift, sensor signal amplifier with digitally programmable gain and output offset.
This library for Arduino IDE allows to program AD8555/AD8556 device.
Both simulation and permanent programming mode supported.

Just a sketch yet, to be rewritten as a proper library.
